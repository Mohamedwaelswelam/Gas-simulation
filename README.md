# Gas-simulation

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of a steady-state natural gas transmission network simulator. The code is part of a larger integrated energy systems project involving coupled electricity and gas networks.

##  Overview

The simulation models pressure and flow across a multi-node pipeline network using steady-state gas flow equations. It includes:
- Nodal pressure and mass flow rate calculations
- Compressor station modelling
- Numerical convergence checking
- Support for structural and load-based sensitivity test cases

This tool enables analysis of how gas network changes (e.g., pipeline length, diameter, load variations) affect system feasibility and performance.

##  Main Features
- Models frictional pressure drops using a simplified Weymouth-based formula
- Handles node balancing and pipeline flow direction
- Iterative convergence via fixed-point update
- Built-in compressor behaviour for key branches

##  Files
- `NewGasModel.m` – Main function to simulate the gas network

##  Applications
- Sensitivity analysis of gas system stability
- Integration with power system models via Power-to-Gas (P2G) and Combined Heat and Power (CHP)
- Educational tool for gas flow and convergence behaviour

##  Output
- Prints pressures at each node
- Displays gas flows per branch
- Shows number of iterations and convergence status

##  Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or later (tested)
- No external toolboxes required
